# MutAd
Google Chrome extension to mute ads and skip them once possible.

## Description
After added to Google Chrome, when watching YouTube clips if an ad pops up MutAd will mute the volume a will skip the ad once possible and unmute.
If mute was on before the ad it will remain in this status.

## Technical Details
Uses native javascript's <b>document.querySelector()</b> to find the elements and manipulate volume. If something doesn't work it is probably because page structure has changed. Please open issues and I'll handle.
